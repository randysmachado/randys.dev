## What keyboard do you use?

[Das keyboard with brown switches](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional/)

## How do you code so fast?

- Vim: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiwGbcd8S7I
- VSCode shortcuts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9kSTiqhUfg

1. Enable `route_localnet` for `docker0` interface:

```js
console.log('JavaScript Code')
```

2. Add this rules to iptables:

```css
main {
  max-width: 1120px;
}
```

3. You can now use `172.17.0.1` to access localhost on the host.

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Ye-ha! She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Don't underestimate the Force. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I call it luck. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. You mean it controls your actions?
